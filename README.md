# Careless Whistle

This is a project made during [Malm√∂ Music Hack Weekend 2013](http://mmhw.eventbrite.com). The project uses HTML5 audio (in Chrome) together with some basic signal processing to detect notes that are whistled in a certain order.

The system have some severe security issues, don't use in production. ;)

# Demo

Currently the demo works in Chrome only

Hint! Try whistling the notes `C, D, E` in order (it doesn't have to be in correct pitch).
